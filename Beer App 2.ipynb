Not for me, when I see people buying this, I cringe. I say to the unaware  masses, \"bad by you\".

It comes out near clear, a hint of yellow, an inch of head that disappears and leaves little to no lacing. Nothing special to look at. \\n\\nS - Nothing to the smell, either. Some usual corn, grass, rice, cereal grain, metal. \\n\\nT - A little barley sweetness, some cereal grain, a watery finish that tastes more like seltzer than beer. \\n\\nF - I put it in the freezer so it\\'d be at its most drinkable. Drinks like any other lager--light-bodied, high carbonation, very drinkable when it\\'s ice cold. I can see why bros shotgun these. \\n\\nO - I just don\\'t get it, I guess. Bud Light is the most popular beer in the U.S. yet it has more calories, more carbs, and is equally-priced to Miller or Coors Light. Rolling Rock is $4.99 for a 6-pack ($2 cheaper in AZ) has more flavor and character, and worth the extra beer belly. I once went to a trendy restaurant with Bud Light on tap and the menu described it as having \"a hint of orange peel\" in the flavor. So, it\\'s really a stretch when trying to sell this stuff to anyone who\\'s drank pretty much anything other than Bud Light in their life. Yes, it\\'s a simple beer with four ingredients. But you can barely taste anything but the water. Continue to baffle me and be the most popular beer in the country, but I\\'m avoiding it at all costs.',\n",

       " u'Bud Light is a high quality mass produced beer. It has a purposeful and unique flavor among other light beers. Personally that flavor is too sweet for my taste. It does not taste cheap, but it does not taste particularly good, although there is no aftertaste to it relative to some other light beers out there. Bud Light has some character, but not much. To summarize, it is kind of like drinking a watered down Budweiser. So it\\'s like buying a decent car but getting the base model. It is okay if that\\'s what they have at the concession stand. It is okay in a cooler at a party. It is okay in a keg. If it was a girl, she would be an okay girl to date. She would be like one of those girls everyone else thought you should marry but for some reason you just didn\\'t want to go there. But maybe on reminiscing you might still think about her sometimes, because she was nice. Bud Light is a \"it\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" kind of beer. As a car, Bud Light is a contemporary Volkswagen Passat. It looks nice, gets the job done, doesn\\'t cost too much, and blends in while being a little different from the others, but not in a way that\\'s interesting or fun. It\\'s an upgrade from really cheap light beer. I want to like it but can\\'t.',\n",

Head is gone in 60 seconds with no lacing (this pint is even nucleated).  The aroma is a muted sweetness along with a beer smell that could come from the yeast.   Taste is minimal with some barely there sweetness and a hint of tartness.  Mouthfeel is thin bodied, well carbonated and dry in the finish.  There is just a hint of butter in the aftertaste but it is not overwhelming.  Overall, OK for an AAL.  I don't remember this beer being this clean in the past.  I wonder if the recipe change to barley & rice only has paid some dividends?\",\n",

The taste is corn and some sweet fruit but the water kills it from there. The feel is watery and light in body. So, if you can't afford a Chimay... save up. That is a beer.

It's great for the party because you've always got a story, but it's not something you'd want to tell mom about unless you absolutely had to. Bud Light fulfills that need for a quickie in the pub, but it's not something that I'd drink all the time. Little to no mouthfeel, with sort of a clearish-golden haze, you know the beer isn't something you keep buying because you want to, it's just the filler until the real beer arrives. The gold standard, it's better than Miller's or Milwaukee's, but nothing compared to more sophisticated beers.\",\n",

       " u'I can honestly say that I wouldn\\'t drink Bud Light if it were the last beer on Earth. Not only does it smell awful, but it manages to taste even worse. It\\'s the one beer I literally can\\'t drink anymore ever since I started drinking better brews. I\\'ll still try to give it a legitimate review. \\n\\nLook: Thin white head on top of a piss-like yellow color. \\nSmell: In all honesty, it smells like vomit and urine. It made me not want to drink it, but I did, because it was a frat party and it was the only beer available. Now, I would pass on it. \\nTaste: Oh, no...Okay. When uninformed people tell beer-lovers like myself that beer is \"piss-water,\" I laugh at them because they\\'ve probably only ever tried Bud Light. Very little flavor, and the little flavor that is present is relatively unpleasant. Corn water maybe? That\\'s an insult to corn and water, though...\\nFeel: Very little carbonation. So, nothing to distract from the gross taste.\\nOverall: Save yourself. Don\\'t try a Bud Light. I know I sound like a troll, or a rival company employee, but the last time I tried to drink Bud Light was the last time I\\'ll try to drink Bud Light. I\\'ll happily give positive reviews to brews that deserve it, but this ain\\'t one.',\n",
       " u\"Basically this is horse piss in a can. Good marketing doesn't make up for terrible beer.  I drank this stuff my freshmen year of college and thought it was amazing. Now as a junior, I can not stand it. There are much better beers in the same price range. Not much to look at, it looks like dirty water. Not much of a smell and a watery taste. I would review the feel but there isn't much of one. Just not enjoyable.\",\n",
       " u\"L-  Looks sometimes can't be deceiving.  Looks better than it smells and tastes, but looks unwell.\\nS- smells like old beer at a 1990s frat party, and maybe the bathroom.\\nT - if you get a very fresh one, it can be almost ok, but usually not even close to good.\\nF - not sure feel should even be a category for this brew.\\n\\nOverall.  Mass produced -no mass appeal.  Beer can get way worse than this.  So I would say if it's the only beer\\nyour Uncle has in the fridge, either don't be picky or take the day off.  Possibly drinkable but not satisfying.\",\n",
       " u\"Look - Poured from a can, clear straw color, quickly vanishing bubbly white head. Lots of visible carbonation.\\n\\nSmell - Sour, metallic, rice cake\\n\\nTaste - Very mild rice, odd and off-putting sweetness, reminds me of a weaker Fosters, no bitterness\\n\\nFeel - Thin bodied, loads of carbonation. Easy drinking, refreshing.\\n\\nOverall - I want to like it because of it's price and availability, but I just flat out don't.\",\n",
       " u\"Okay. So here is my story. \\nI love good quality beer and I knew very well that this won't be one. I also have to say that in my near 50 years, I have never tried this thing. Largely because I don't like cheap quality beer but also because I don't see the point to light beer. So honestly, when I purchased a can of Bud Light today, I was giddy and a bit scared at the same time. But I promised myself that I will go through some mass produced beer, in order to put things into better perspective.  \\nAnd then it happened. I opened my first ever Bud Light.  \\nI immediately went for the nose and it smelled like rat piss. This fades a tad but not much. This beer smells bad. \\nOkay, but how does it taste? I took the first sip. I tasted some malt and very heavy carbonation and then, quite rapidly, nothing. I mean I tasted nothing. There was no aftertaste either. I took another sip, just to be sure. A slight favour, poof, gone, nothing. And then it soon became evident that I wasn't drinking beer. I don't know what to call this, but it's not beer. But because it doesn't taste bad (as I said, no taste), I can't trash it. It's a not bad (or good) tasting liquid. Its biggest drawback is the bad carbonation that caused me to burp every minute and my chest actually hurts from the trapped gas. Not fun. \\nSo in conclusion, I am confused. I have no idea what I just had and I know I will not have it again, but it wasn't awful. It just wasn't anything.\",\n",
       " u\"Pours a straw yellow, lots of fizz, light/medium head. Mouth feel is a light watery carbonation.

       " u'Bud Light pours brilliant straw with rapidly rising streams of bubbles under a 1\" white frothy foam cap with fair to poor retention.

The palate offers faint apple, low grain, very low hop bitterness, low to no hop flavor, with a dry and slightly tart finish. It has a light body and is highly carbonated. There is a very slight slickness on the palate and a slight carbonic bite. For what it is, it is well made. There is just not a lot there.',\n",
       " u\"I take it from reading the previous 100 reviews that the raters have not grasped the concept of light beers.   They are not brewed to taste good, they are brewed so that sone overweight smuck can convince him/her self that this will be good for their physic.   It's a watered down version of another beer. Of course it taste like dung.   If you watered down a Coke, that would taste bad too.  As far as watered down beers go, this is one of the better ones.   Actually for a brief second it taste like a regular lager.  Hey if you buy a cheap car you ain't gonna race at Daytona.   If you buy a light beer you're never gonna be happy if flavor is what you're after.\",\n",
       " u'Never been a real fan of any of the BMC lights, but for fair review\\'s sake, I\\'ll explain Bud Light through the eyes of a college student looking to get trashed. \\n\\nLook: Gross, pale yellow. Better when hidden behind the aluminum. Huge plus if you have the opaque bottles. \\nSmell: Pro tip...don\\'t smell it. Hints of bleached asshole come to mind.\\nTaste: Mostly water. If you can recall the flavor of Bud heavy, take that and make it a 50/50 water mix, and voila. \\nFeel: Light. Airy. Easy to suck down via funnel or shotgun. \\n\\nOverall: Huge waste. It tastes, on a good day, equal to any of the Keystone/Busch/Rolling Rock competitors, but it costs 50% more. There is no reason for anyone to ever buy Bud Light. If you spend extra money to \"avoid\" the other low quality AAL macros, but find any difference in Bud Light, you\\'re lying to yourself.

       " u'Can\\'t say that I\\'m huge into light  beers.  I accept that they have a place and purpose, one that I\\'m slowly accepting as I continue to age.  Why pay for 4.2% ABV when you can get 5%, 5.9%, 8%, 10%, or even higher for the same price (or even less in Bud Light\\'s premium-price-point case?)  Well, because I can drink as much light beer as I want and function the next day as opposed to two 40s of high gravity which are now leaving me FUBAR and wishing for death.  \\n\\nThe Budweiser brand has gone to Hell since it\\'s new foreign ownership.  I felt embarrassed even buying Bud Light since I\\'m not a flaming liberal, which is their current advertising target.  Enjoy your death spiral A-B, it was your decision. \\n\\nReviewed from a 20 pack of 16 fl. oz. aluminum bottles.  As always, I\\'m keeping the style (light lager) in mind and comparing it to other beers that I\\'ve had in that style.  \\n\\nA: Poured into a Budweiser glass purchased at the Fairfield, CA brewery.  1.5 fingers of head from a soft pour that shows large bubbles and takes less than 30 seconds to dissipate.  A barely intact foam ring lasts the entire glass with some patchy floating foam on top.  Surprisingly there are some rings of lace on the way down.  Color is not as light as expected and must be close to that of \"regular\" Budweiser, impressive for a macro light beer.  A small amount of \"floaties\" when held up to a strong light.  Not at all uninviting.  \\n\\nS: Almost nonexistent until the beer warms.  Iron, faint sweet malt, light green apple.  Any hops are lemony and spicy.  There is nothing off-putting which I guess is a home run here.  It reminds me of what melted ice in a hotel room ice bucket smells like in the (next) morning.\\n\\nT: Bland, even for a light beer.  10% Budweiser, 90% carbonated water.  A-B must make a fortune on this beer.  It takes a few of these for my palate to start detecting anything other than salty and metallic.  Really light malts and rice with some lemon.  You\\'d have to be familiar with the A-B family of beers to recognize and understand any taste.  Close to alcoholic water but, again, nothing off-putting.  This reminds me more of Natural Ice than Budweiser.  (I guess I\\'ll need to review Natty Light now.)\\n\\nM: Probably the most champagne-like, super carbonated beer that I\\'ve ever had (sorry Miller High Life.)  Carbonation stings the tongue but is not creamy.  The extreme carbonation gives the beer some substance when really there is none.  Eventually there is a puckering and lemony dryness that is not pleasant here.  The rice adds the creaminess missing in the carbonation.\\n\\nO: The least flavorful light beer that I\\'ve ever had.  Bud Light\\'s look, smell, and mouthfeel are able to partially substitute for it\\'s lack of flavor.  If I wanted to get drunk on carbonated water I\\'d pick this beer.',\n",

The balance is slightly towards the malt as the flavors are not strong. \\n\\nFeel: The body is light and watery with a slight carbonic and metallic bite in the finish. \\n\\nOverall, this is a light beer with slight balance towards the malt but little else in the way of flavor elements.',\n",

It smells of piss and urinal cakes.\\nYou know that smell. \\nLike walking into a walmart or public park bathroom. Greeted by pee, feces and a slight rose like smell in the air\\n\\nThe look is slightly yellow and highly carbonated.\\nIt looks like any old light beer.\\n\\nWhen you pour it into a glass it has a 2 finger head if its brand new out of a cold can.\\nOtherwise, its fizzy and reminds me of waking up at 2 in the morning having to pee.\\n\\n\\nLets face it. This is a cheap beer to be drinken by people who want to  have alcohol in their body fast. Not to be enjoyed or rememebered.\\n\\nFor me it reminds me of camping, and has a nostalgic vibe of walking to the camp grounds bathroom and being greeted by the overwhelming smell of pee and dew in the air.\",\n",

Yank Me Crank Me (but don't wake up and thank me).  Scream Dream.  Wango Tango.  I was a confused overly aggressive teenager.  I liked that music.  But the man is horrible.  I'm not going to go into the deets.\\n\\nThe other day I heard that the Bud Light concert series included a concert by Terrible Ted.  Someone put together an online petition to be presented to Bud Light.  Then suddenly with no announcement, the Nugent concert was removed from the Bud Light website.  Good for them.  So never having had Bud Light before, I thought I'd give them a head nod and try the product.\\n\\nI'm impressed.  I mean I was not expecting this.  This is decent.  No, it's not IPA.  I love IPAs.  In the summer I like to drink something lighter.  When I'm scraping decades old caulk off the windows in the hot sun, I tend to consume more liquids, and I'd prefer it to be great tasting beer rather than lemonade so I like something with lower alcohol content or I'll be featured in a World's Dumbest Carpenters video or America's Funniest Home Videos.\\n\\nThe color is your typical 70s beer urine coloring.  It's clear, not cloudy.  You see some bubbles bubbling up.  The smell, oh the smell, brings me back to when I was a kid and my dad would drink cheap beer.  I remember smelling it at a block party.  And the taste is very, very mild.  I mean there is just a hint of a taste, not much.  But it goes down smooth and gets the job done.  I guess I should get back to scraping that old caulk off now.\",\n",

       " u\"Time to review the world's most popular light beer. I can honestly say that I have never had this before. Even before my craft beer days, I would always have selected a regular adjunct lager over one of these. Here goes: Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a pale straw amber with a faint gold tint and a bare half finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of light, sweet biscuit malt and a faint hint of grassy hops. Flavor is very mild sweet adjunct malt with a distinct rice component (not sure if it is used, but this is spot on for Japanese rice lagers) with a hint of biscuit finishes with mild grassy hops. Tastes watered down. Light bodied with active carbonation. I'm baffled by the number of people who compare this (and other adjuncts) to piss; there is no real comparison. It tastes exactly like it is intended: a light, flavor attenuated mild beer that will offend almost no one. The slightly sweet malt is as inoffensive as it is uninteresting. A watery, mildly sweet malt and mildly hopped light lager. The only surprise here is how watered down it tastes. That makes it hard to understand as a session beer; really boring. This is a one and done. There is no reason to return this (except under desert island scenarios). My apologies to my Seattle Beer Week glass; we will not speak of this again.\",\n",

The amount of bubbles tells that it's heavily carbonated.\\n\\nNot only does it have almost no color, it has no smell either, except for feint hints of sweet cereal grains.\\n\\nAt this point I was hoping that the smell would be misleading, and that it would at least have a decent taste, but no, this tastes like carbonated water. No malts, no hops, just water and a bit of those cereal grains, which are noticeable in the aftertaste.\\n\\nIt feels light, thin, watery, and overcarbonated.\\n\\nOverall, drinking this was a terrible experience. This is beer for people who don't like to drink beer. Don't get it? That's okay, neither do I.\",\n",

       " u\"What can you say about Bud light? Its very drinkable. When the situation is right, This is a decent thing to have. Partying or When you are mowing. It isn't flavorful.The lack of flavor is probably a good thing, in some situations. Low ABV. Once again, Bud Light is good for partying.  The Smell, is kind of putrid. But seriously, who would smell this willingly? Taste, is actually a strong point, Supreme Drinkability. Beery Water. Very light, With a hint of malt. Corn too. Appearance is straw yellow, and pale. In line with the style. Feel is carbonated, light and easy to drink. Not my personal choice, as i am not fond of light lagers, as they really don't have much in flavor, but I wouldn't turn one down, if it was offered, unless I wasn't in the mood to drink. Isn't bad isn't good. Boring, and forgettable. Could do worse for style though, which is Macro BMC light beer.\",\n",

Where are the malts??? \\nTASTE: Initial taste consists of mild water flavors with hints of bitter hops. Mild water flavors enter immediately after along with subtle spicy hops and hints of corn adjunct flavors. Finishing off this disappointing symphony, strong water flavors enter as all previously flavors fail to push through except for spicy hops, which remain subtle.\\nFEEL: Light-bodied and overly carbonated. Carbonation stings the tongue. This does go down somewhat smooth, despite the high levels of carbonation. This finishes crisp. \\nNOTE: Still better than Coors Light.\",\n",

       " u'Cant stand how people view this as \"americas\" beer, tastes downright gross but then again when you need to drink something cold and cheap on a hot day, some may find nothing better.',\n",
       " u'Poured from the can into a standard pint glass.  Canning date on the bottom is June 10th, 2015.\\n\\nLooks very, very pale yellow (when pouring, it\\'s like ever-so-slightly yellowish-tinted water), very clear, with a lot of good-sized bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass at all times.  The color is a bit dull.  But pale and dull as it is, it does still look like beer.  Actually a decent-sized head of white foam on top, especially when poured quickly, and though it shrinks fairly fast some of it does hang around for a while.  It even forms the standard \"ring\" around the outer edges of the glass.\\n\\nSmell is... well, not the greatest at first.  The first thing that comes to mind is \"farty,\" though this is most noticeable when you first pour and fades away pretty quickly afterward.  There\\'s also a hint of a metallic sort of smell.  When I had one before I picked up a bit of something that reminded me of cooked vegetables, but I\\'m not really getting that now.  After the \"farty\" smell fades, the metallic kind of thing also seems to go away and  you\\'re left with only a little of a slight bready beer-like smell.  The smell is very faint overall, though, so the not-so-pleasant aspects of it are not at all overpowering; you pretty much have to put your nose in the glass and sniff to pick up much of anything at all.  Chances are that unless you actively try to smell this beer you will not really notice its smell at all.\\n\\nThe taste is overpowered by the fizziness of the carbonation at first, but once that dies down a tad there\\'s a very light, dry bready sort of flavor there.  As with the smell, it\\'s very faint; unlike the smell, thankfully, there really aren\\'t any unpleasant elements like farts or metal.  Unfortunately, when you drink more than a sip that nice dry bready flavor shifts more to a sweeter, not as pleasant one -- reminding me mostly of white bread after you\\'ve started to chew it up, when the starches are already being broken down into sugars by your saliva.  That\\'s what it tastes like to drink a big gulp of Bud Light.  I\\'m noticing today that I am also getting a slight bit of that \"cooked veggie\" thing in the taste, though thinking about it a bit I wonder if maybe it\\'s actually closer to that funky smell rice makes when it\\'s cooking.  I suppose that would make sense, as I know I\\'ve read that the Bud line of beers uses rice as adjunct rather than corn.  Overall the flavor isn\\'t unpleasant, but it is pretty bland and one-dimensional.  There\\'s just not a lot to it -- it\\'s pretty much just a dry-ish bready malt/rice sort of thing, no sign of hops or anything.  Seriously, why not add some hops in? Most of the calories in beer come from the malt, so you\\'d think the \"light\" beers would have no reason not to add in at least as much hops as the \"regular/heavy\" version, if not a bit more.\\n\\nFeel is like fizzy water, pretty much.  By far the most insubstantial feeling beer I\\'ve ever had.  If not for the carbonation it would be a whole lot like just drinking water; I haven\\'t tried plain carbonated water so I can\\'t say if it\\'s *exactly* the same, but I imagine it\\'s not far off.  I suppose that\\'s exactly what they\\'re going for, what with this being a \"light\" beer and all, and it does make it easier to drink huge gulps at a time if you want (though sadly, that makes what little flavor is there not as good, so it\\'s a little counterproductive.)  As with the taste -- nothing really unpleasant about it, but there\\'s not much there.\\n\\nOverall, there\\'s just not a whole lot to this one.  I figure that\\'s probably the defining feature of a light beer -- being weak, bland, watery, and well... light.  However, I really can\\'t rate it *that* low because, as mentioned above, there\\'s really nothing unpleasant about it either -- it\\'s a beer defined by its sheer blandness, for better or worse.  I wouldn\\'t ever buy this for myself, but there\\'s nothing offensive about it either and I\\'d certainly drink it for free if offered -- better than a glass of water, albeit not by a whole lot.  I just can\\'t form any strong opinions on it because there\\'s so little there to form an opinion on.  I suppose if  you want something that doesn\\'t taste like much but still gets you buzzed, this might not be all that bad of a choice -- but I can\\'t imagine that there aren\\'t any more-flavorful alternatives even in the \"light/lite\" beer category.',\n",

       " u'Bud Light is an odd beer. Among craft brewers it often gets a bad rap for its very plain taste, little to no aroma, and it\\'s unremarkable standard beer color. However given its history and pedigree it remains one of the top selling beers of all-time. Popular from college campuses to football parking lots. It can be found in literally ANY bar, pub, tavern, or place that has a liquor licence in America (and dozens of other countries for that matter). It is the Diet Coke of beers. Nothing special right? Wrong! My chemistry teacher who taught me 400 level Chemistry of Fermentation, when askes what in his opinion was \"the best beer in the world\" responded with confidence and without hesitation \"Bud Light. Anheuser  Busch products are made with some of the strictest guidelines and with the most state of the art brewing equipment. Their brewing facility is kept within a tenth of a degree temptress range meaning if you have a Bud Light in Boston or Hong Kong your having the same exact beer. Not alot of breweries can pull that off.\" So the next time you snub you nose at a Bud light because they use rice filler just remember that they set alot of the standards that our precious micro - brews strive for in modern brewing.',\n",

Some sheets of spotty lacing was seen when sipped. The aroma is really nothing to mention, just some light grassy grains. The taste is pretty much the same. Very watered down with not much taste. Ends with a slight metallic taste which might or might not be from the aluminum bottle. Light-bodied with above average carbonation. Why I drank some of these over the years before I discovered some good brews and brew-styles is beyond me. Overall. why bother to drink this, no matter what fancy/cool bottle they use.

Why would I ever buy something as dull as this? Sure, if it came out from the tap in my kitchen and was provided publically, I'd drink it the same way I drink water. But to buy a case of it? No way, I'd rather drink publically available tap water instead. \\n\\nLastly, I know this is tangential, but the Bud Light can is my least favorite design of pretty much any beer I've seen. It's not outrageously bad, it's just so damn boring, while lacking in class. This might as well be a energy-drink by the look of it. Which sort of reflects my take on the beer in general.

       " u\"Boring and bland for sure. Not a lot of flavor.  Busch light is better.  Busch light is my lawn mower lager in the summer time. Bud light doesnt tank simply because it is one of the easiest beers to drink period. Supreme drinkabilty takes this beer where it needs to be. Comparing this to other BMC beers, this is better than coors, mainly because of the metallic taste present in coors light. Miller lite is a little stronger flavor. For what this beer sets out to be, which is a bland boring beer with very little taste, it reigns supreme. This is for people who just want a hint of beer taste. This isnt really something i would compare to Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams.  Its just a light beer. This is one of the best party beers in my opinion. Sam Adams Boston Lager was my first good quality beer. i've had so many beers i can't really remember which one i had first. had to have been SA Boston Lager or Blue Moon Belgian white. Then my 3rd one was Bud light. I actually enjoy Bud light. I have nostalgia with Bud. Its been me and my buddy's fishing beer and party beer since 2 years ago. Lot of memories. The alcohol wasnt what made the memories, its the being with friends all having a good time. the fact it was Bud Light just makes me like this beer. May not be good compared to real flavored beer. Its just my official party beer. You bring in the bud light,  its usually my first 30 pack finished at the party, followed by the coors light and bud light lime. People i party with also love corona. Pretty much, you will find this at any party worth a damn, or Alternatively Miller lite or Coors Light, or Busch too. I've brought busch, we're talking southern parties in corn fields with bonfires. brought some busch light and some bud light, and it was a good night. Any party worth anything at all will have bud coors or miller, or maybe busch, but other than that none of the off brand products. This is the supreme party beer for beer pong.

Honestly when you first start drinking beer, you want something with a little flavor but nothing too strong. The reason i say this, is i started with blue moon. I almost hated beer from the beginning because i tried something so strong. Then, my friend gave me a bud light. I took a drink. It was nice and refreshing and didn't overwhelm me with flavor.  It was good. The reason people buy bud light, and its the number one selling beer in america, is because it doesn't offend. Its light, doesn't have much flavor and is really refreshing.

       " u'Bud Light. Bud Light. It\\'s so popular I said it twice. Ask me again, I won\\'t be so nice. \\n\\nBud Light is the #1 brewski around these parts, and also in most of the US I assume. What\\'s so great about it? What\\'s so not great about it? I\\'ll crack a bottle and hash out the details...\\n\\nServing style : 12 oz glass bottle, poured into Miller Fortune glass (there\\'s an idiosyncrasy)\\n\\nAppearance (1.5) : Pale straw-like color with minimal head that disintegrates rapidly. Lots of bubbly carbonation. \\n\\nSmell (2.5) : Rice malts, A little floral, faint copper. Lots of sweetness. Clean water. Reminiscent of Budweiser. A good bouquet. \\n\\nTaste (2.5) : Smooth and crisp. Fairly delicious. Super carbonated, belches come almost immediately. Nothing specific pops out in the flavor, so I\\'m reaching a little when I say I taste corn, husks, a little malt, and some residual grain sweetness. A smokey metallic penny flavor wraps it up in the finish. So there\\'s nothing really offending here.\\n\\nBud Light is hard to hate because there\\'s so little to it. There\\'s no flavors to point at and say \"that\\'s not right\". Without much there, there\\'s not much to criticize. All\\'s well that ends well. \\n\\nMouthfeel (1) : Spiky, painful carbonation. Drinks like a brick. Leaves a slightly pasty dry finish.\\n\\nOverall (2.07) : I know why people buy this stuff, it\\'s because there\\'s almost nothing to be offended at and it drinks like a soda. When you have no taste, there\\'s less chance of bitterness or off-notes. The longer you brew a beer, the more broken down it gets, and thus you have \"light\" beer. I far prefer the full taste of Budweiser over a Bud Light, about 10 to 1, but Bud Light isn\\'t half bad if you\\'re looking for a refreshing drink for the crowd that no one will object to. Best beer ever? That would be ludicrous. Best beer for frat parties? That might even be stretching it. Best beer for beer-ignorant taste-challenged rowdy boys and girls who sit around the bonfire sharing prepubescent humor and chasing tail - now that\\'s more like it.',\n",

       " u'Ever since the dawn of man, since the first Homo sapiens wandered the ancient Earth... Mankind has striven towards greatness. From the invention of the wheel, to landing a man on the moon, humanity has come so far, and yet for every question answered, many more are asked. We still search for an understanding of our place in the universe... Humanities accomplishments pale in comparison to the vastness of the cosmos... Looking up to the stars we realize how little we are, how precious life is. We have built particle-accelerators and telescopes in an attempt to further our feeble understanding of the universe. How can we understand the mind of God? How can we that are imperfect understand perfection?\\n\\nWebster\\'s dictionary defines perfection as \"the condition, state, or quality of being free or as free as possible from all flaws or defects.\"\\n\\nSuch a definition seems to be beyond our understanding, to transcend anything we could comprehend. \\n\\nI am here, however, to argue that we have achieved such perfection. An invention of man, more monumental than the invention of fire or the wheel... More so than the creation of freedom and democracy (god bless America). I stand before you today, to share with you the greatest accomplishment in the history of mankind. True perfection in liquid form. The elixir of kings, the concoction of champions, the American made beer, rated a perfect 5/5 stars, number one selling beer in the world, BUD LIGHT. \\n\\nOur journey begins with a can. A brilliant royal blue and silver cylinder... A certain luster... a certain glow... One that immediately distinguishes itself from all other canned beverages. The way the light reflects off the polished can... A display of beauty unrivaled by anything in the known universe... The presentation is without flaw. \\n\\nBy now we have grabbed the can, unable to resist. The can beckons to us, the promise of refreshment, the assurance of smoothness... Who are we to reject such a righteous gift? The can is opened by the desperate prying of our unworthy fingers... The hissing sound of escaping air... A sound heralding the start of a journey, the beginning of an adventure. As we move closer, our nostrils are stimulated by the fumes of whole-grain hops, the smell of superior drink-ability. Such a tantalizing fragrance... A scent more sweet than a bouquet of flowers, an aroma more pleasant than the sweetest perfume. \\n\\nThe first sip. A moment of pure bliss... Of majesty, of grandeur.  To express it in words is a difficult task, such magnificence transcends the English language. It is like describing colors to a blind person. Pure ecstasy... Our taste buds attempt to tell our brain... I try to tell the readers... There is no language, no medium, no form of communication equipped to convey such an experience. I Implore you, noble reader, nay I beg you, go to the nearest grocery store, the nearest gas station, and invest in a can of Bud Light. Adding a 12-ounce investment of Bud Light to your portfolio is an investment in America, and an investment in your future, and it will bring many returns. \\n\\nThank you for your time and attention. God bless you, God bless Bud Light, and God bless the United States of America.',\n",

That smell that is ingrained in my memory from high school parties and football games. What can I say? It's nostalgic.\\n\\nT - Have you ever had Perrier? Or maybe just decided to chug a bottle of club soda out of pure boredom? It was kind of like that, only distilled in adjunct grain juice for a while. It sounds bad, but if you're expecting it, then it's tolerable. In the right mindset, you can even quite enjoy it.\\n\\nM - This is what I actually like about this beer. It's refreshing, crisp, and has plenty of carbonation. Good for a hot day when you don't want to do anything, including thinking about the beer you're drinking. Very light bodied. Reminiscent of water.\\n\\nO - I'm not saying this is a bad beer. I'm saying this is the beer that I keep on hand in case someone who isn't my friend asks for a brewski while I'm hosting a party. I'm not going to turn one away if it's the only thing available.\\n\\nMy advice? Grab some buds and go somewhere that serves a proper brew.\",\n",
       " u'A- Pale, clear and golden. Lots of carbonation with no head. Minimal lacing.\\n\\nS- Pale malts with a rice backbone. No hops. \\n\\nT- Typical light lager. Not much different from the rest. But I like to drink beer. And every beer has a right time. This lager has mild flavors and is basically carbonated flavor water with a little bit of alcohol in it. It tastes good after a hard fought volleyball or baseball game in the summer heat when a water would be better but a beer sounds great. Or when you want to sober up. This light lager is ok. No better no worse...\\n\\nM- Goes down easy and classy. A little too carbonated and not enough aftertaste for me.\\n\\nO- Well as most young people I also started drinking beers like this, and enjoyed them. Recently I have experimented with all sorts of different types of beer and discovered that I prefer a more complex flavor. But at the same time I think this beer has a time and place. Not my favorite but its ok.',\n",

The color is light yellow, the flavor is barely there, slightly bitter and a touch rice-y, and the mouthfeel is like carbonated water. \\n\\nOverall, this beer is great when throwing them down in beer pong...but not in many other circumstances.',\n",

I wish they'd get a clue because Bud Light is absolutely disgusting.\\n\\nI usually opt for a mixed drink instead in those situations. I have to be REALLY trashed to enjoy a Bud Light. This beer is watery, pissy, gross, and tinny. Doesn't matter if it's in a can, tin, bottle (slightly better), or glass. It's still the same cornbread piss fest in a blue and silver package.

Although I do enjoy darker beers now I got to say bud light still holds a place in my heart. lets be real you can grab a 30pk at times for $16 during a major holiday or sporting event.

Corn. Vegetal matter. Slight metallic bittering notes near the finish. Leaves a cardboard-like staleness in the mouth that lingers long after the swallow. The warmer it gets, the more stale it gets, until it's nigh undrinkable.\\n\\nMouthfeel - Watery light, with lively carbonation. Smooth, at the very least.\\n\\nOverall - How do I loathe this beer? I'd take a Regular Bud, Coors, Miller, all the other lights and even most of the Natty products over Bud Light. It's easily the worst of all the beers the macros have to offer. How this beer is the number one selling beer in the US continually eludes me... and yes, I did save this beer for my 666th review. :P\",\n",
       " u\"Alright. Finally had it after I've started rating. Was hoping to try 100 beers first. Pours with a light white head of foam that gradually dissipates entirely.

       " u\"This isn't a great beer. It is weak and smells bad. It does go down pretty smooth. Not sure if that is because it doesn't have much of a taste or what. It doesn't rock my gut like bud heavy does. Though I prefer Bud heavy this is a decent alternative.\",\n",

It\\'s beer for people who don\\'t really like beer but want to think they do. Ill admit that I spent my teen years being brainwashed into thinking this is what a brew was meant to be. I went on the tour in St. Louis twice, visited the tasting room, pet the Clydesdale, and heard the spiel about premium this, and age old technique that, got the t-shirt, etc. Well for years I have been drinking the stuff out of ignorance and finding that I didnt really care for beer.\\n\\nI ended up only buying it or drinking it when I had to. Baseball games, Festivals, Casual lunches, etc but never once did I look forward to it or crave it. It was more less an mandated activity among friends. I could end this story by saying Anheuser ruined beer for me but I have have happier story in progress. One fine day I stopped into a bar for a lunch date only this wasn\\'t just any bar, it was a premium beer only bar. Now up until this point I have only had PBR\\'s, Coors, Miller, Bud, what have you and assumed that because they were the most popular that had to be the best. Boy was I stupid and the bartender was quick to point out that Macro brews were banned and that if I wanted a similar taste I could get a good draft beer and pour it into a pitcher of water. On that note I decided to make the rounds and went on a tour of all the finest micro brews that they had to offer. I settled on Morelien OTR as my favorite and to this day I have yet to touch a Bud Light. \\n\\nI don\\'t wan\\'t to come off as a snob since there is an evident majority that prefers the Market beers but there is also a growing minority of beer lovers who demand a better beverage and I\\'m so thankful that the craft beer community is exploding and raising the bar.

The extremely understated pale and bready malts allow bland adjuncts to leave Bud Light quite watery in the mouth. Seltzer watery, specifically. It reminds me bit of dry sparkling cider because of the light body, tingly carbonation, and very weak aftertaste of tang. \\n\\nI guess I prepared myself for even worse, but BL pretty much sucks. I cannot imagine how poorly it would taste if it weren't super chilled. Even Bud Light Platinum is significantly better, at least according to my review. Get me an ale!

       " u\"A Remarkable Absence of Flavor --\\n\\nPhoenix, AZ - the heart of the American Southwest. Here, at the NASCAR Sprint Cup, the pulse of red state America is crowned with the roar of the 45 jet engines and for a few sacred hours, the air fills with the shrill ecstasy of speed, fury, and corporate sponsorship.\\n\\nBud Light is crucial to the race environment, lubricating the proceedings and driving the fans into a watery, dream-like state. Complexity, character, and flavour are traded in for the easy consumability and mass appeal which characterises the entire event. In this context, Bud Light becomes a symbol, a quaffable embodiment of the American spirit. It fills the drinker with a crisp, slickly produced, dilute sense of pleasure that quickly fades and leaves a curiously hollow feeling; a sense of longing and dissatisfaction that can only be recovered with another $7 purchase. \\n\\nMy first sips of this beverage, from its embarrassingly designed aluminium bottle, were remarkably absent of any sensation at all. When cold, this beer is indistinguishable from soda water. As it warmed, a soft, sweet flavour appeared to fill the drink's middle space. None of this was unpleasant; in fact, I was impressed by the skill with which this beer was executed. In the end, there are no faults, flaws, or any hint of character whatsoever. There is energy here, but no substance.\",\n",

You can taste some slight corn, grains, and malt, but it really all gets overpowered by the extreme carbonation. Hops are basically irrelevant and almost completely unnoticeable. The beer is about as thin as they come.\\n\\nHaving had many of these throughout my college years, I\\'ve come a long way.

Slight sweetness throughout with no hops. Finishes like a sip of water.\\n\\nM- Like a fizzy water. Light with the capability for massive chugging.\\n\\nOverall, it's what you expect for the style. It's an AAL that's been named a light lager. If it had more flavor, then it would be a light lager, but a very bad one. As far as AAL's go, pretty much the standard middle of the road.\",\n",

I understand that the reasons I dislike it are basically the reasons it sells so well. I'm not trying to change that. I'm just not a fan of that kind of beer. At all.

       " u\"Tallboy can from the LCBO. Listed at an even 4% abv, with 'brewed in Canada' proudly displayed on the label for some reason. I'll preface this review by mentioning that I've never had Bud Light even once until now, so I'm about as unbiased a reviewer as you'll find around here.\\n\\nPours a pale straw yellow, topped with a little more than a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that fizzles itself out of existence in a matter of seconds. A thin, wispy cap remains on the surface. Tons of bubbles rushing to the surface... yep, this is a light beer alright; it looks like every other one I've ever had so I can't really knock it too hard in this category. Clean aroma, with faint hints of grain malts, sweet rice, and little else. \\n\\nI find that with light lagers, it is more important that the flavour be 'not bad' than it is that the flavour be particularly good or memorable. Bud Light meets this prerequisite, because I can't honestly say it tastes like much of anything at all. It's a little grainy, with elements of corn husk and wet straw, but mostly it just tastes diluted and watery. Of course, it's a light lager, so that's kind of the point I guess. Like the rest of its light brethren, it is thin-bodied, highly watery, and possesses a firm bite from the carbonation. I'll pay it this one compliment - it's pretty refreshing for a beer. Almost as refreshing as water.\\n\\nSo what did I think of my first Bud Light? Well, it's pretty much what I expected - like someone took one-fifth of the volume from a can of Bud and replaced it with water. That being said, it's an acceptable light lager, with a bland, inoffensive taste. \\n\\nFinal Grade: 2.68, a low C-. I would take this over Coors Light, but realistically the difference is so negligible that I'd probably just get whichever was cheaper. Or, more likely, something less crappy.\",\n",

A little bit plastic and a quick finish.\\n\\nVery light with a ton of carbonation.\\n\\nBud Light is watered down, low on flavor and barely tastes like beer.

However there is some flavor, most notably the rather single-faced malt flavor. I would describe its flavor as having been bleached, you can tell its there, but seems to have been intentionally weakened.\\n\\nMouthfeel: Good carbonation, and when combined with ice cold temperatures does an effective job covering up any other features of the beer. When let raise to slightly higher temperatures though, the mouthfeel does develop some more texture, very light be it at that.\\n\\nOverall: I found it very hard to review this beer, I could not distinguish any individual ingredients.

It was very easy to drink (which I pounded 2 just fine). Of course it lacked most any noticable quality beer flavors but just as well nothing tasted bad to note either. I had fairly low expectations and this beer was somewhat refreshing and a pleasant surprise. Its basically the same as Coors and Miller lights, which I have no real trouble drinking either. Of the 3 macro lights I'd rank this one slighty less than Coors and about equal to Miller. All-in-all though their all the same.\",\n",

However, most people do not care enough for this beer to be poured into a glass, so it is nearly universally served in the can.\\n\\nS - I don't know how they managed to make this smell so little like beer. The smell is unrecognizable to anything I've ever had home or microbrewed. The strongest smell is aluminium, even when poured out of the can. There is a pungent, unpleasant odor that doesn't quite remind me of hops, it's wrong some how.\\n\\nT - Awful. That's the word. Even in my most decadent mood, I still can't finish an entire can of this beer. That is really saying something. The taste is a decided step down from water. I can think of no redeeming qualities of the taste.\\n\\nM - Somehow this beer makes my mouth feel dryer, but not in a way that makes me want to drink more. It is a particularly hard beer to drink if you haven't spent years growing accustomed to it.\\n\\nO - I believe the combination of mass brewing with low flavor ingredients like rice (to replace barley) and poorly cultured yeasts yield a massively inferior beer. This is truly the bottom rung of beer.\",\n",

I little bit of cereal adjuncts, grains and hint of sweet malt immediately following the pour. Then virtually nothing.\\n\\nT - Grainy flavors and a bit of alcohol upfront. Sweet malty body with a large dose of cereal adjuncts and just barely perceptible hop bitterness to help balance the malt. The finish is a sweet flurry of adjuncts followed by a stale-cereal aftertaste. \\n\\nM - An iota thicker than seltzer water. Becomes a bit of a chore to drink as the beer warms.\\n\\nThis is the beer of choice for my father-in-law and I get him a 12 or 18-pack every time he visits. He missed one this time, so I decided to take a trip down undergrad lane and review it.

Surprisingly enough, there is some lacing left on the glass after a first exploratory sip. \\n\\nI am fascinated by the carbonation of this thing. Watching the playful bubbles rise fast and furious from the bottom to the top of the glass is quite something. They are working hard! \\n\\nSmell: Huh... there is no smell to speak of. If anything, a distant metallic aroma mixed with damp corn left on the field after a late-summer storm in the Heartland. \\n\\nTaste: Huh... there is no taste to speak of.

Even a piece of generic white bread would alter the experience, because there is no flavor here!\\n\\nMouthfeel: Extremely watery, thin and dry. Low (non-existent, actually) body and flavor, but substantial carbonation. \\n\\nOverall: Drinkable for sure, but why would I want to drink this?

A little corn, barely any malt and a ghosting of used up hops.\\n\\nTaste: Take a can of regular Budweiser and mix half of it with an equal amount of seltzer water. There you go. Some corn, a little semi-sweet, stale malt and used up hop sneaks in at the very middle and end of the tasting.\\n\\nMouthfeel: Pretty well carbonated. But oh so watery. Very easy to put down though and on a hot day, I could see it being very good.\\n\\nOverall its not horrid like Coors light. I think it's a step down from Miller Lite.

The nose is pretty one sided on this, all I get is sour adjuncts and sour malt, really nothing else to speak of. I mean it smells like an adjunct lager, but to the point where is almost doesn't even smell like beer anymore. Is the flavor terrible? No, but it is very weird, and by no means good. Very watery in the front end, and frankly all the way through the drink. In the middle you get a little malt and a little sourness, and in the end you get a very weird, funky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is horrible, nothing good there whatsoever. The drinkability isn't terrible, but that's only because it tastes like water, gross water. Overall, it's ridiculously light, almost no flavor at all, and in some areas it has some significantly gross flavors, compared to other adjunct lagers. Not hard to drink, not a god awful taste, but overall pretty damn bad.\\n\\nP.S. it did end up giving me ok lacing, one funny note on that though - when I poured in the rest of the bottle, the head fizzed away in less than 10 seconds, probably 5.\",\n",

Loaded with carbonation. \\n\\nS - Smells like what it is, inexpensive light brew. Not great. Not great at all. Luckily, it doesn\\'t have much smell because what the smell it does have is pretty terrible.\\n\\nT - Tastes like watered down Budweiser, because that\\'s what it is. Carbonation bites and this thing is very crisp. Flavor isn\\'t overwhelming by any means, but I think they nailed it with the \"drinkability\" slogan. Taste instantly reminds me of college. I could easily slug a gross amount more. \\n\\nM - Very watered down, thin. After having literally any other type of brew (other than another light lager) you realize that this thing isn\\'t bringing much to the table regarding substance.\\n\\nO - This beer is satisfying and comes into play at all the right times. This and Miller Lite are my tailgating beers and my beach/pool side beers. I\\'m not sure what the \"real beer drinker\" does when they go to a tailgate, pig pickin\\', or to the pool/beach, but I bring these badboys with me every time. Refreshing as can be under the sun and compliments an eastern NC BBQ sandwich like you wouldn\\'t believe. Clearly, these beers come into play when doing (generally) 1 of 2 things: either slugging brews all day in the sun or stuffing my face with delicious food before a football/baseball game (without getting overly full).\\n\\nCheers.

A good amount of bubbles racing to the top of this beer, marginally large. Wow, clear and yes just yellow in color.

None of the yeast or density one sees in a good german lager or other lagers with character. \\n\\nThe smell is just awful. Sweet corn and alcohol? That honestly sounds way too good. Is it possible that this beer smells of water? \\n\\nThere is malt in this beer that isn\\u2019t awful, but the beer finishes with this metallic (this was from a bottle) and alcohol like finishes. I used to think of bud light as flavorless and over carbonated beer. Today this beer has a decent flavor to start that finishes in such an awful and terrible finishes that I truly am baffled why people drink it. This beer is only tolerable on the front of the tongue. Drink quickly (the norm) at the finishes is just painful going down. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t understand the drink ability stuff. This is painful to drink. It is over carbonated, the finishes it terrible, and frankly just why do they make it? \\n\\nI know this is odd to say, but there is a lot more flavor than people give credit to this beer. It has a decent malt start (for a lager) but it just goes to hell from there. That metallic/alcohol finishes is terrible. 4.5% and it has that kinda awful finish? So how do I score this beer? It is a light lager which I don\\u2019t get. It has as many calories as Guinness so I\\u2019m not sure what light even means. It isn\\u2019t diet as there are calories. It isn\\u2019t any more summer weather than something even like their \\u201cbud heavy.\\u201d Why do people drink this? Ultimately there isn\\u2019t anything about this beer that stands up to a good beer.

I go in for a smell and despite the voluminous head and vigorous carbonation, there is no smell. it is, to say the least, creepy.\\n\\nTaste is painfully unremarkable. It so similar to seltzer water, I can't figure a difference. Some fucked up skanky ass homebrew would be better, at least I would have something to hate instead of this maddening middle class style apathy. \\n\\nMouthfeel is on par for the style, like carbonated water. Nothing remarkable about it, but nothing offensive. \\n\\nOverall, I don't like this. I don't want anymore. I don't want to finish the glass.

As bad as I want to smell some hops, they just are not present here.\\n\\nT: The metallic smell is picked up in the taste as well, but not as strongly as the nose. Tastes like carbonated water or club soda with a pinch of grain. No hop taste to be found.\\n\\nM: Probably the best part about this beer. Extremely thin and dry but smoother than I had anticipated.\\n\\nO: Far, far from a good beer but I know for a fact that I have had much worse.

The small amount of flavor that is present is sweet and has a hint of corn and maybe sugar.\\n\\nMOUTHFEEL: The Bud Light I had on tap was not well carbonated and it felt more like drinking water than beer. It offers nothing interesting to the palate.\\n\\nOVERALL: If I\\'ve already had six beers, OK, I can manage to drink one of these, but as a first beer of the night it is simply not worth it to me.

       " u\"Rating a beer like Bud Light is difficult because I know we should rate by style and expectations for the style, but as a person that enjoys the taste of beer, I find it difficult to be objective. When I drink a beer like this, I think to myself this doesn't taste like anything! This beer was very pale yellow with a nice little cap of white foam, perhaps the beer is carbonated differently on-tap compared to in the can/bottle, but this beer had nice head and retention leaving nice layers of lace on the glass. The beer had very little aroma, no hops to speak of and just a bit of corny graininess. The beer is very watery, not much hop bitterness, no malt flavor and there is a little bit of residual sweetness. This is just not what a beer should be. This what you should drink if you are thirsty after mowing the lawn or at a 100F baseball game in the middle of summer.\",\n",
       " u\"From can to pint glass\\n\\nPours a very light yellow, like the color of your piss if you've been drinking a lot of water. Lots of bubbly carbonation, forms a small 1/2 inch head that dissipates immediately (which is likely intended). No lacing to speak of. The bubbly carbonation swiftly carries the bouquet, which is unfortunate because it smell like nothing. Maybe faint hint of bulk wheat. Yeast had a slight lemon note, hops are non-existent\\n\\nThe taste is even less interesting. Some whispers of toasty grain way in the background. Lightly astringent citrus notes from the yeast, really no hops. Literally tastes like a light lager mixed with soda water. Feels like soda water too, almost no oily complexion at all. \\n\\nSo why is this one of the best-selling beers? Marketing alone doesn't explain it, although that's a big part of it. Really, I think there's a large swath if people out there that don't like beer, or don't like it that much, and beer flavored water is palatable. Granted this beer isn't the worst tasting beer I've had, there's nothing off-putting. But that's a little like saying the air in my mouth doesn't taste bad.\",\n",
       " u'I usually can appreciate all types of beers but this one is just not good. It literally tastes like water with a very slight doughy yeast. Thats it! How can they sell this with confidence?

No hop taste, really no malt not even grainy malt just a lot of water with carbonation and that usual Budweiser yeast taste that is it... and I had this on tap bought by a friend. Definitely not a beer... they should have another name for this beverage.',\n",

       " u'#46. The \"Biggest selling beer in the entire world\". Considered ideal for underage-and-financially-limited drinkers\\' go to beer, this beer is genuine for those who lack appreciation of and have barely begun to develop a palate for... better beer. This is my unbiased review of a bottle I have obtained, my first (and certainly last) bottle of Bud Light EVER, dated \"Born on 17 Nov 2010\". As recommended, the drink was on the ice-cold end of the serving spectrum (40-ish degrees) as I served this beer to myself. I won\\'t lie, I thought it would do much worse than it did.\\n\\nPoured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass at room temperature. \\n\\n(Appearance) Pours a 1.5 finger depth fizzy foamy head that retains poorly, fading to little more than a thin patchy smog cover within a short few minutes. Lacing is also dull and faint, doesn\\'t retain and doesn\\'t stick. Color is very pale straw yellow, crystal clear and carbonation is pretty average but lively and consistent. The head was a major letdown, but otherwise, there was not too much to say negatively about this beer\\'s appearance. It doesn\\'t look terrible, but this is easy to tell that the beer isn\\'t going to be phenomenally characteristic nor exciting from the pour. 2.5\\n\\n(Smell) Some faint grainy malts, perhaps some light wheat and an overall strained clean grassy smell. I don\\'t get any hops or characteristic flavoring, nothing that draws this beer from a lineup of other critically panned light lagers. It doesn\\'t even smell specifically like a light beer; it\\'s inviting due to it not smelling horrible, but it\\'s not impressive nor exciting. 2\\n\\n(Taste) As half of the name states, an incredibly light taste. The grainy smell gets even lighter at this point, tasting like very little grain, wheat, or really... anything found its way into this beer. Also, no hops nor other flavoring can be found in the taste at all. Incredibly light and easy drinking for a large audience but for myself, insipidly bland and unenjoyable. The greatest complement I can offer the taste is that it isn\\'t revolting or nasty. It is just very, very bland, and tastes like a short step away from water. Bummer. 1.5\\n\\n(Mouthfeel) Super light bodied, obviously. A bit crisp from the mouthfeel, perhaps even more than it should for its own good, but I really can\\'t see this having any less carbonation than it does. If it were flat, this would be an outright revolting beverage. As for the finish... there is none. There is no bitter finish and there is no aftertaste. What little flavor I get from the taste washes right down the gullet with the rest of the brew on a sip-by-sip basis. Reminiscent of seltzer water... yawn. 1.5\\n\\n(Drinkability) As drinkable as water, meaning that if you like water, you\\'ll like this. It leaves the palate longing for more than it gets. A party beer for the price but not a casual beer drinker\\'s beer, especially if they drink a halfway decent arrangement for a living. Because I drank this slowly and laboriously, I\\'m not going to say this has a very high drinkability in my book, but in lieu of it\\'s light body leaving me far from full, any person could have several of these in a row before feeling satisfied. I don\\'t dig light beers in general, and accordingly I am not impressed much with this beer. 2\\n\\nVerdict: You get what you pay for. A 12 pack was a notch above $10 for me, which leaves me wondering what kind of amazing six packs of beer have been screaming my name all along. Devoid of flavor, character and body, this beer might play a role of bringing non-beer drinkers into the crowd, but please for the love of beer, don\\'t convince a soul that this is the Zenith of beer. You all know far better than that. I\\'ll close the book on ever considering this my go-to beer. D- (1.85)',\n",
       " u'Bad beer Thursday 2011, week 1. Every week for the year of 2011, on Thursday nights, I will give a \"bad beer\" a fair rating and review. This week, Bud Light. \"Smooth and refreshing light beer\" - I\\'ll be the judge of that.\\n\\nBeer poured from a 12 ounce blue can into a stange glass (I thought this the most appropriate). I poured the beer hard and was surprised by the amount of head I got on it, seriously huge. Beer is clear and light yellow with moderate and steady carbonation and a huge white head of medium bubbles that slowly falls away leaving some lacing on the sides of the cylindrical glass. Beer is completely clear, I can literally read through the glass. Looks like beer.\\n\\nAroma is sweet and almost soapy. It has this odd late aroma that is pretty off putting but it does not have that terrible boiled corn aroma some of these beers get.\\n\\nBeer is served ice cold, as per instructions, and as a result, all the flavors are on the back half of the palate. The front 1/2 to 2/3 of the palate are completely blank. It is literally water until the grain bitterness at the back, and I use bitterness loosely here. There is a slight aftertaste but for the most part it is like drinking water.\\n\\nI picked Bud Light for the inaugural week of Bad Beer Thursdays 2011 because I could not honestly say that I had actually had this beer. I hate Budweiser (the company) as much as the next guy, their market presence dilutes the craft market but as far as a beer goes, this is about as plain and bland as it gets. There\\'s really nothing wrong with it, no off flavors, just a nothing watery beer.',\n",

       " u'BeerAdvocate needed a picture, so I got the can, and might as well rate it. Head is pure white, medium dense foam, which quickly settled down leaving no lace. What lace that can be generated by swirling has no body nor cling. Color is a 1 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of corn, wet corn. Taste is mild to say the best, not much there, but that of cereal grains, mostly corn. Water has as much mouthfeel as this beer, I guess because this beer is 99.9 percent water anyway. I guess at 4.2 percent alcohol by volume it is better than nothing. Yard work, garage cleaning beer.',\n",

Some sweetness with that taste as well.\\n\\nM: Light to medium carbonation with a very light body. \\n\\nD: I can see why this beer is so popular for macro beer drinkers. There's no off putting smell or taste. There's nothing at all to this beer and that's why people will think it's so good. Basically for people who want carbonated water with some alcohol in it.

       " u'This classic watered down lager is the perfect beverage for you and your frat buddies to slam down in mass quantities. Budlight is the standard american light beer. Its extremely light yellow color and low on taste. There is virtualy no head on the beer even as u pour it. \\n\\nThis beer is better during those summer beach days and back yard cookouts where cheap beer is necessary.',\n",
       " u'I drink this in cans on the golf course, and bottles at home. It is easy to find and cost effective. It tastes good, goes down good. It kills the thirst after mowing, and while playing golf.\\n\\nBesides it is no fun being a beer snob. If it all tasted the same how boring would that be?',\n",
       " u'Poured at the end of a long day into a plastic cup. Surprising head that lasted longer than i expected. No real aroma. Clean taste with slight sweetness. Rice? No hop aroma or flavor detected. Fizzy mouthfeel with lots of bubbles. Clean aftertaste. Thirst quenching and enjoyable. A tried and true staple macro lager.',\n",
       " u\"on-tap at home.\\n\\nIt's kind of funny how all these ppl on here cry cause this beer is watery? What do you expect from a light beer?\\n\\nThis beer is the king of drinkability. Pours a light yellow, smells grainy like all american lagers and goes down super smooth.\\n\\nI know all the craft beer ppl hate this beer and blame its popularity on marketing but you all know a top craft beer wouldn't sell like bud light with a huge marketing campaign. People like easy to drink non bitter beer and something thats low on calories. I enjoy craft beer as well but I like my american adjunct the best.\\n\\nWe all enjoy beer and it would be a boring world if everyone had the same taste buds.\",\n",
       " u'I think a lot of people go into a macro beer review with the preconceived notion that the beer is going to suck simply because it is a choice of the masses, but I\\'m going to try and give it a professional review without being biased. \\n\\nI think this is the number one selling beer in America. I guess price and drinkability has a lot to do with this. It\\'s also well advertised with their slogan \"superior drinkability\". \\n\\n(A) The beer pours a light amber color with a typical head that foams and mellows quickly and lacing that holds average retention. \\n\\n(S) Picking up any aroma is very difficult. I guess I smell close to nothing with the exception of a mild tangy bitterness from the hops. \\n\\n(T) It tastes like a typical light lager with twice as much water making it very hard to bring out any of the characteristics. \\n\\n(M) There\\'s a lot of carbonation and sting in the mouth. I guess crisp is just another word for sting. \\n\\n(D) I guess it\\'s drinkable. It\\'s not hard to swallow, but I do feel like I just paid too much for a bottle of water afterwords. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t buy it for myself, but I would buy it for guests because almost everyone I knows swears by Bug Light for some reason.',\n",
       " u\"A - Three fingers worth of crisp, foamy, slightly rocky pure white head... Audibly fizzy... Fades to about a half fingers worth before displaying some retention and then fades to a feel even lacing with a slightly thicker collar... A very pale straw yellow color... Mostly still with stray small bubbled exceedingly flow carbonation ... \\n\\nS - Not much at all in terms of aroma... It's a struggle to pick up much... Cereal... Corn... Slightly musky... Perhaps some wet grass... A touch of lemon...\\n\\nT - Fresh corn... Bland cereal... A touch of sweet lemon... Not much else... A struggle to \\n\\nM - Gone before you know it... Light bodied... No real carbonation... Very little to rate in this category... \\n\\nD - The appearance is slightly disappointing and this one only proceeds to go down hill from there... I could drink a couple of these in the proper setting, but as you would imagine this is not one I would ever seek out or recommend... There are far superior light and adjunct lagers...\",\n",
       " u\"At a holiday open house hosted by a business client, the only beer choices were this or Budweiser. I chose BL since I didn't want to incur the additional calories that would accompany this assault on my palate.\\n\\nA-Have no fricken idea. The room was dark and the bartender just handed me the bottle with a holiday napkin that I considered unfolding to conceal the bottle, and my embarrassment. Didn't ask for a glass, because didn't want a harmless and otherwise serviceable accompaniment to my beer enjoyment to also be abused.\\n\\nS-The only thing evident from the smell was confirmation I was drinking beer. Mostly smelled of day old, wet, cut grass.\\n\\nT-Taste? This was a liquid assault of my palate. Only regret is I am not allowed to rate it zero.\\n\\nM-Probably the best attribute. I can imagine this being just barely satisfying if drunk very cold and quickly on a hot afternoon.\\n\\nD-I would sooner drink pond scum.\",\n",
       " u\"Pours a very clear yellow, with not a lot of effervescence. \\n\\nSmell really isn't there. There is a smell of something, but not much.\\n\\nFirst sip is mellow. Is this beer? Yes. Then again, that depends on your definition of beer.\\n\\nLet me rephrase that, a McDonalds hamburger is still considered a hamburger. In its essence, it IS a hamburger. It has beef, it has condiments, it has two buns. But is it something that you'd personally feel good about showing off to ones friends as ones life contribution to society? No, no you wouldn't.\\n\\nI'd have to say that there are two ideas about success that exist in the world of beers today. One says that the best quality beers will fill what niches they will, and that their qualities in ingredients make them the best. The other says that that the beer that the most people drink is the best drink around. Bud Light has succeeded in one of these categories. I doubt if it could ever succeed in both. \\n\\nI doubt that Burger King or McDonalds will ever make a burger worth a five star restaurant, and I doubt that Anheuser-Busch will ever turn Bud Light into anything more than a beer for the masses of those who have no idea what real quality beer should taste like, but that should not take away in the least from what AB has accomplished. Hopefully, the world will change someday to make what they have done irrelevant. \\n\\nPlease, let it be soon.\",\n",
       " u'Served in straight pint glass. Poured the thin, clear yellow expected of the style with just a thin cap of white head that had no retention or lacing. A slightly sweet grain aroma was the only noticeable thing in the nose.\\n\\nOn the tongue, again a very faint, slightly sweet grain taste is the only feature. The body and drinkability were both average for the style.\\n\\nIIRC, this is the best selling beer in America, so clearly lots of folks like this brew. I found it to be a fairly average example of the style.',\n",

This beer really does not look appetizing. \\n\\nS - This has a very faint smell, but it's nothing you would really want to smell a lot of. Basically smells like any other macro lager.\\n\\nT - The taste pretty much follows the nose. It's very watered down, no good flavors really stand out. This is not a good beer, and it leaves a bad aftertaste in the mouth.\\n\\nM - This has a very light mouthfeel with normal carbonation. Feels watery, and leaves a bad aftertaste.\\n\\nD - Does not go down too easy because of the flavor. The fact that its watery makes it go down quickly though. I could drink a lot of these, but it would feel like I was punishing myself.\",\n",
       " u'Pours clear yellow with a very small shirt lived white head. Very little aroma and little to no flavor. Palate very light body and carbonation. Finish is very bland with virtually no flavor. It was the only beer available at a barbecue. Overall did not like this at all.',\n",
       " u\"Had one of these the other night at a party just because of beer pong. Figured it was time to finally put up this review.

It's just awful. Can't stomach it. I generally avoid it completely if I can since my introduction into craft brews.\\n\\nM: Thin, overly carbonated, and all around bad.\\n\\nD: Others have been giving this a higher rating in this category just because of the popularity. Frankly I find it extremely difficult to get it down because of the high carbonation and awful flavor. It makes me sick.\",\n",
       " u\"Appearance: Pale yellow, clear, light head that disappears very quickly, good carbonation.\\nSmell: Very faint. Can detect some barley and hops, maybe rice.\\nTaste: Very weak and watery. Can barely detect an aftertaste.\\nMouthfeel: Light and watery, carbonation is medium frothy.\\nDrinkability: Exceptionally high.\\nSummary: This is a horrible beer. I gave it a 5.9/10, or an F. As far as beer goes, this one's not a good choice. If you're in need of light beer, then I would say it's okay. It's cheap, highly drinkable (because it's basically like drinking water), and can get you drunk if you drink enough of it. In my younger days this was the standard beer of choice for parties (Due to cheapness, availability, and drinkability). This beer loses a lot of points for taste and satisfaction, but gains a few for drinkability. So if you're goal is to get really drunk or supply several guests with beer and save money, then by all means go for this beer. If your goal is to enjoy a great beer, look elsewhere. I wouldn't drink this beer again unless the only other available options were the rest of the commercial light beers.\",\n",
       " u\"47th review on BA\\nCan to pint glass\\n\\nI really have a lot left in the house as you can see from some of the reviews the last two days.

I haven't had a BL in YEARS so wanted to get in on the rating of this bad boy.\\n\\nApp- It's a very pale yellow with no head to speak of and no carbonation. Its stagnant like a pond no one goes to anymore and the wind doesn't blow.\\n\\nSmell- I smelled so hard that beer went in my nose and still didn't smell anything.\\n\\nTaste- I don't want to finish it. I was trying to see if it was that bad and it was. I don't understand how BMC sells so many beers?\\n\\nM- Its slick and watery\\n\\nD- NO\",\n",

Carbonation implies that he may have drank some of my tonic water before urinating in my glass. Will do later tests to confirm this.\\n\\nS- Like a skunk, after I ran over it, minus the marijuana appeal. Carbonation in my nose feels like I just bumped seltzer water.\\n\\nT- Chewing a penny, with some kind of club soda like appeal that makes you reminisce about the time you lost that bet that you could hold your breath for a whole minute and had to chew on a penny with club soda because your friends thought it would be funny.\\n\\nM - see above.\\n\\nComments: I have had this beer many times--none of which were by choice. If I could, I would sue the owner of this company for sexual harrassment. As the can is consumed, the taste gradually reaches the threshold of fecal matter-y taste, mixed with the delicious hints of rusted iron gates that just makes you unbelievably happy that you risked physical harm in order to try this delicacy of a 'beer'.\",\n",

This beer is inoffensive, low in alcohol, and low in flavor. \\n\\nLets be honest, if you're drinking Bud Light you're not drinking it for its flavor or complexities so you shouldn't be surprised that they're not there. Over the years I have played a number of drinking games and downed many pitchers of this stuff. It's not good, but it's not bad. It's just a shame that this is what so many people think of when they think of beer.\",\n",
       " u\"Bud Light is my favorite beer to start when starting a session. It has a better taste than Coors Light and has less of an after taste. The color is light and relatively generic. The smell is relatively non existent. The taste is fairly good. This is fairly easy to drink. It's impressive by any means but I still enjoy it. It is exceptionally better when chilled. This beer in a can can be hard to drink one after another because the flavor becomes bland and dry.\",\n",

Living in Australia it is only very recently that it has become available and I have always wanted to try the beer that is consumed in larger quantities than any other in the world. Ultimately I have had worse beers because Bud Light is not offensive to drink. It is, however, highly offensive that this watery concoction is called beer.',\n",

To think I used to drink this stuff regularly.\\n\\nM- Light as can be. Carbonation hands in the mouth in the slightest. Leaves a nasty aftertaste.\\n\\nD- Well, you have to drink these fast. There is absolutely nothing to savor. If anything were to contribute to drinkability is that you can't taste alcohol and its not thick.\\n\\nNotes: Luckily the United States has been blessed with craft and imported beer.

It has a sickening sweetness to it and almost no hop character to speak of. Terrible.\\n\\nMouthfeel: Has the feel and consistency of sparkling water.\\n\\nDrinkability: A thoroughly revolting beer.

Tastes pretty decent for an adjunct beer, sweet with heavy notes of grain and cereal. the carbonation is just right, but maybe a bit too intense, giving the beer a kick when you pour back a big sip of it. very bland and average I must say though, nothing stands out to me in the flavor. Mouthfeel is nice... Cold, sweet, and bubbly. I rated a 4 for drinkablity because it is definately a beer that just about anybody could enjoy a few or more of without getting bogged down and full too quickly. overall not bad, I think this would be a good beer drink anytime but probably wont be very enjoyable without pizza or something to add a little flavor between sips.',\n",

That lightness is a huge difference between Budweiser (good) and this (not so).\\n\\nT: Very light, the lager trends towards tasteless.

The lightness is a distraction.\\n\\nM: There isn't much mouthfeel here, a bit of sweetness and then nothing.\\n\\nD: Easy to drink but I'm not sure that I'd want to.

       " u\"Served in pint glass poured from a table tapper.\\n\\nFirst off I'll start by saying that I'm well aware that there are worse beers out there. This beer was free because we won it during trivia. The choices we were faced with was Bud Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Light, or no free beer. Faced that horrid decision we settled for this as the upset consensus pick. \\n\\nNow to the beer. It pours a extraordinarily light pale golden as if water was poured into already lightened beer. The head is a decent white foam that fades quite rapidly. I smelled almost nothing, which I've learned isn't the worst thing. What I do pick up is a bit of corn and wheat sugar and a little bit of sour. The taste is predominately the sweeter corn like tastes that are the preference of many redneck. There is also the bitter tasting backer which i can only assume is the flavor derived from trying to smooth out and lager mass produced grains that are of lower quality. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated as I would expect from the very light body. The drinkability depends on your personal preference. While it may be physically easy to drink this, the more you consume of it the more you will hate your life. And as a funny side note this probably has a similar amount of sugar per volume as Guinness. So why would you choose this? There are cheaper things out there if cost is the issue. Perhaps this is the minimum level of quality people can tolerate drinking in mass quantities. A good standard to note as I soon shall accompany TMoney2591 in Swill Tour 2010.\",\n",
       " u\"Served in a shaker pint glass at Finn McCool's.\\n\\nWho doesn't love free table-tappers? If only we won Quizzo more often...

The nose is very weak, comprising some very light wheat, rice, and corn syrup notes. The taste ain't much better, with bad blackened wheat and puffed rice dominating the proceedings, while some mildly sweet corn syrup tries vainly to clean things up a bit. (I'm not sure what I mean by that, but it made sense while I typed it.) The body seems infused with helium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather watery feel.

I guess AB isn\\'t really expecting you to pour this from the bottle.\\n\\nEven when stuffing the nose inside the glass, the smell is pretty much non-existent. Smell is of the typical, adjunct corniness and not much else. Is this what rice beer smells like? Possibly.\\n\\nTaste is right there with the smell, non-existent, except for a strange, uninspired after taste of plain white rice and bland corn. This should be considered beer for people who do not like the flavor of beer, because there is really no discernable flavor to speak of. My description may be making this brew look good.\\n\\nCarbonation is a bit high, giving one those huge, totally repulsive burps that so often accompany consumption of a brew of this type. Other than that, I feel the mouthfeel on this is about average for a light lager. Drinkability is also average due to the very mellow alcohol content and that great, non-existent taste. Overall, a very unimpressive, below average light lager that should generally be avoided. The fact that I took time out of my life to review this is a miracle, but I suppose that I have had worse. Always open to trying new things, but this thing is one that you should say \"no thanks\" to.',\n",

Strong initial carbonation bite, skunky middle, and finishes off bitter. Aftertaste is warm and of burnt grains. \\n\\nDrinkability - The only time I would ever drink this is at a party to get drunk. You'd swear the pong balls make it taste better. It certainly will do the job, but it isn't pleasant to drink by any means.

Because of that, I based my review on the same principle. With that being said, there is no better, inexpensive, readily accessible beer that I know of that\\'s better than Bud Light. No matter what time it is, what place is open, you can always count on them to have Bud Light ready, waiting, and cold.\\n\\nA cold beer while you are working on the car, or mowing the grass, something that you are going to slam and drink fast, Bud Light is where you need to be.

And it\\'s not too horrible to boot, given the circumstances I\\'ve put above. 9 o\\'clock at night, not too hungry and you want to have a nice beer with some tv? Perhaps a Bud Light is not the best call. However, if you are out to dinner with your in-laws, completely uncomfortable, and you need beer, fast...

It has this slightly skunky sickly sweet character to it. I can't make out any hop aroma here. It is also pretty grainy but nothing else stands out.\\n\\nTaste- There isn't much to speak of here. It has a kind of grainy of biscuity taste with a slight malt taste. Nothing that stands out but nothing offensive either. It is clean and I guess refreshing.\\n\\nMouthfeel- Watery and carbonated that is about all I can say.\\n\\nDrikability- I have been known to take down a twelve pack of these pretty easily. That is the only redeaming quality here well that and they are pretty cheap. They don't fill you up so you can keep on pounding them. Which my beer pounding days are over any way.\\n\\nOverall- It makes me a little nastalgic sometimes about the time I spent with this beer but it isn't anything special. I can't believe I actually used to like this stuff. I mean it isn't the absolute most horrendouse beer I have had but if I had to order the macro lights it would be probably on top of Busch Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Light. I know it is hard to compare beers that are almost identical but there are a few subtle things I like about this one compared to the other clones.\",\n",
       " u'A: The pour is even lighter than I recall. Clear with an ever so slight yellow tint and lots of CO2 bubbles. The head disappears almost instantly.\\n\\nS: It smells pretty much like what you would expect: nothing. A slight grainy sweetness, but no skunk or hops or anything else, really.\\n\\nT: Like the nose, there really isn\\'t much to this beer. There\\' some sweetness provided by the grains, but otherwise it\\'s very watery and bland.\\n\\nM: Normally I don\\'t mind the mouthfeel of light and adjunct lagers because they\\'re quite bubbly and I enjoy that part of them. This, however is just so thin and doesn\\'t have that same level of effervescence.\\n\\nD: It is \"drinkable\" because it\\'s so water-like, but I really have no desire to drink more of this beer. It\\'s just so bland and flavorless; I would rather take another light lager over this.',\n",
       " u\"A: Light yellow color. Crystal clear. Zero head.\\n\\nS: Smell of slight grain, but nothing really there.\\n\\nT: Watery pilsner taste devoid of any hop flavor.\\n\\nD: Yes you can drink 50 of these in a single sitting... you still won't be drunk but you can.\\n\\nListen, it is what it is. Some people don't drink for flavor, they drink the easiest thing they can. The only redeeming factor to this beer is the fact that you can drink 400 if it's the only thing around. I get into this situation in remote areas and you just have to get through it. Better than water... maybe...\",\n",

As laughable as \"drinkability\" is as a marketing campaign, there\\'s no denying that this beer is easy to drink in copiously large quantities (the local BL distributor sponsors my rugby team, so I know this from far too much experience - man I wish we could be sponsored by DFH!). Not quite as watery as Coors Light, though, so I don\\'t think this is quite the most drinkable beer in it\\'s category.\\n\\nNotes: Of the big three macro light beers, this is definitely my favorite. Miller tries to taste like actual beer, but only succeeds in tasting like the shittiest beer possible. Bud and Coors, on the other hand, try to make a beverage that combines a trace amount of alcohol with the mildest grainy flavor possible. Of this approach, Bud clearly does the better job. While not worthy of even the remotest amount of actual respect, BL is my go-to beer when I simply have to be drinking a light macro.\\n\\nCheers!',\n",
       " u\"Poures a crystal clear straw yellow with a compact head that dissapates quickly.\\n\\nNot much of an aroma to speak of, other than a fainnt skunky smell. Taste, well, there's not much there, watered down and somehow that skunky (Maybe rubbery is a better description) aroma seems to manifest itself in the flavor. Thin bodied w/ high carbonation, the only real purpose for this beer is for getting drunk or for people who don't know any better, because you definetely wouldn't drink it for flavor. Oh yeah it gets nastier as it warms up too, it needs to be drunk ice cold.\\n\\nIn essence, this stuff is bad, even for cheap light beer this stuff is bad. Miller light is better, coors light is better, even Natty Light is better. But of course, this is the #1 beer in the world.\",\n",
       " u\"I was given this beer for free at a ball game by a family member (who thought he was doing me a favor by buying it for me...and I appreciated the gesture).\\n\\nAppearance: Very pale yellow, highly carbonated, with minimal head and no lacing on the plastic cup it was in.\\n\\nSmell: Faintly sour and vaguely malty. \\n\\nTaste: No hops, mostly weak malts and water...very bland and watery. Slight metallic taste. Became almost toxic tasting as it got warmer.\\n\\nMouth feel: Like carbonated water. weak and fizzy.\\n\\nDrinkability: Uh, no. Sorry, but this is everything that is wrong with American macro brews. Watery, terrible (and almost non-existent) flavors and just a waste of time. Just another reminder of why I have NEVER been a drinker of light beers in my life. Hate the stuff, especially the big macros like Coors, Miller and Bud. It's just watered down bad beer. Yuck.\",\n",
       " u\"Not sure why this is so popular, marketing I guess. Doesn't exactly look like a beer but it looks like it hopes to wish to want to be a beer some day. I gave it the extra .5 on appearance because it had some bubbles in it. Tastes and smells like not a whole lot, maybe like somebody filled half the glass with a very light pilsner and than filled the rest of the glass with water. There's a slight trace of some grainy like flavors but even then they aren't very good, whatever they are.\",\n",
